## Get Started with MAMP

1. What is MAMP?

MAMP stands for Macintosh, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. MAMP is an application that can be installed under macOS and Windows with just a few clicks and it allows you to have access to a local PHP server and MySQL server. This software turns your computer into a localhost. This allows you to run PHP code, and gives you access to PHPMyAdmin so you can build websites and create databases on your local computer.






















## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/uththara995/Get-Started-with-MAMP/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/uththara995/Get-Started-with-MAMP/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
